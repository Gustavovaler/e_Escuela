## What is the problem?

Communication by digital platforms between teachers and their students presents a series of difficulties that have been highlighted in this pandemic. Using social platforms such as WhatsApp, e-mail, etc. does not have a centralized and accessible space to send assignments, make reviews and inquiries from teachers to students, etc. All this because the aforementioned media were not created for this purpose.


## Soluci√≥n

For this reason, I decided to start this web project to provide a centralized platform where teachers can
upload your files and the students download them in an accessible and organized way. Facilitating the work that both teachers and their students do to achieve their objectives. 

Currently the situation in Argentina governs the suspension of classes for an indefinite period.
That is why it is sought that this initiative is public knowledge. With the aim of solving the aforementioned problems and that it is a tool that is used in the classrooms virtually every day.
